** THE PASSAGE USED FOR FAKE AUDIOS**

Machine Learning is about making machines get better at some task by learning
from data, instead of having to explicitly code rules.
• There are many different types of ML systems: supervised or not, batch or online,
instance-based or model-based.
• In an ML project you gather data in a training set, and you feed the training set to
a learning algorithm. If the algorithm is model-based, it tunes some parameters
to fit the model to the training set (i.e., to make good predictions on the training
set itself), and then hopefully it will be able to make good predictions on new
cases as well. If the algorithm is instance-based, it just learns the examples by
heart and generalizes to new instances by using a similarity measure to compare
them to the learned instances.
